A gem for converting between hiragana, katakana, and romaji.

This gem:

* does _NOT_ convert kanji characters
* adds Japanese kana detection and conversion methods to the String class
* uses [moji](https://github.com/gimite/moji) to detect and convert kana
strings (i.e., hiragana, katakana)
* uses code from [romajinizer](https://github.com/joeellis/romajinizer) to
convert kana to romaji and vice versa

Since this gem is not backwards compatible with either gem, following
community etiquette we have republished this gem under a different name and 
started over with the version number.

Versioning is based on the [Semantic Versioning standard](http://semver.org/)

Added a few more edge cases ('n romaji support),
Started gemifications so it can easily be used in any project
Added normalization for double nn so that こんばn will still be converted to 
こんばん properly
